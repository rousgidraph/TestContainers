# Test Containers. üõ•Ô∏è

### What are test containers? 
[Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) is a Java library that supports JUnit tests, providing lightweight, throwaway instances of common databases, Selenium web browsers, or anything else that can run in a Docker container.

### Why use test containers?
There are several uses for a throwaway database in testing, but among the highest is giving a testing environment that is as close to prod as possible. 

### Who do you need to use test containers? 
1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) To run the containers
2. A supported JVM testing framework:
   * JUnit 4 - See the JUnit 4 Quickstart Guide
   * Jupiter/JUnit 5
   * Spock
   * Or manually add code to control the container/test lifecycle
3. Your java development environment.
